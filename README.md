# Portfolio built with ReactJS

This is my portfolio website, which contains my projects, profile, and a contact form the user can directly contact me. I built this website as a hands-on practice after I self-learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS. This website can be seen at <a href="https://makih2003.github.io/portfolio/">https://makih2003.github.io/portfolio/</a>

## Built using:
• ReactJS<br>
• NodeJS<br>
• EmailJS<br>
• SCSS<br>
